This is a private project that I made to practice my javaScript knowledge.

The point of the "game" is to click away as many red squares as possible.
Every click the score counts +10 and ever x seconds a new red square appears.
The game is over when the board is entirely red.

I did not really make this with the purpose of making an enjoyable game to play,
but rather I wanted an excuse to use different javaScript functions and apply 
them.

This game could be made more enjoyable by (for instance) turning it into a 
whack-a-mole game. This could be easily done by setting the default background
for each div (now white) to a pile of dirt, and instead of making them turn red
making them show a mole.

The game currently has some problems still. I may improve on it after expanding
my javaScript knowledge.
